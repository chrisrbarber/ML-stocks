# ML-stocks

This is a project I've been working on to try to use machine learning to predict the stock market. This is done in LSTM_it.py which uses a stateful LSTM to predict AAPL stock prices. It works ok, although isn't much better than the trivial case of assuming that today's price change will be the same as yesterday's, and can likely be improved with some tuning.
