# ML-stocks

Here's one of my first attempts at using machine learning to predict the stock market. This is done in LSTM_it.py which uses a stateful LSTM to attempt to predict AAPL stock prices. It works ok, although isn't much better than the trivial case of assuming that today's price change will be the same as yesterday's, but can likely be improved with some tuning.
